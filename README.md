# Example codes in computational stochastic processes

This repository contains all the example codes presented in course *MATH97016/MATH97094: Computational Stochastic Processes* in Spring 2020.
The Jupyter notebooks, in both `.ipynb` and `.html` formats, 
can be generated from the *Python* files by running `make` in the repository.
In order for this to work,
the following programs are required:

- GNU Make (or equivalent)
- Jupyter 
- Jupytext

The latter can be installed e.g. via `pip`:
```bash
pip install --user jupytext
```
